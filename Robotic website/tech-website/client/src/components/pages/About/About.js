        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>
          Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL) is the most comprehensive academic
          centre for multi-disciplinary robotics
          <br /> research in the UK. It is a collaborative partnership between
          the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) and <br />
          the University of Bristol, and home to a vibrant community of over 450
          academics, researchers and industry
          <br />
          practitioners. Together, they are world leaders in current thinking on
          service robotics, intelligent autonomous
          <br /> systems and bio-engineering. An internationally recognised
          Centre of Excellence in Robotics, BRL’s state-of-the-art
          <br /> facilities cover an area of over 4,600 sq. metres (50,000 sq.
          feet).

            <h1>Our mission</h1>
            <p>
              The primary mission of BRL is to understand the science,
              engineering and social role of robotics and embedded intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, the key challenges surrounding adaptive robotics,
              namely: dealing with people and their unpredictability,
              unstructured and uncertain environments, and equipping robots for
              flexible roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              BRL is a unique collaboration that harnesses the collective
              strengths of its partners to spearhead Britain’s efforts to be a
              world leader in modern advanced robotics.
